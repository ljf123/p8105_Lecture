```{r setup, collapse = TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

## Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too! 
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

## Learning Assessment

```{r learning_assessment}
la_df = tibble(
  sample = rnorm(500, mean = 1),
  gr_th_0 = sample > 0,
  abs_value = abs(sample)
)

ggplot(la_df, aes(x = abs_value)) + geom_histogram()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
